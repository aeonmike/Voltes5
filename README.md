# Wafer---Web-Application-Firewall-Easy-Route

```A web application firewall```

WAF, is a security tool for monitoring, filtering and blocking incoming and outgoing data packets from a web application or website. WAFs can be host-based, network-based or cloud-based and are typically deployed through reverse proxies and placed in front of an application or website (or multiple apps and sites).

WAFs can run as network appliances, server plugins or cloud services, inspecting each packet and analyzing application layer (Layer 7) logic according to rules to filter out suspicious or dangerous traffic.

```Why Is WAF Security Important?```

WAFs are important for a growing number of organizations that offer products or services online—this includes mobile app developers, social media providers, and digital bankers. A WAF can help you protect sensitive data, such as customer records and payment card data, and prevent leakage.

Organizations usually store much of their sensitive data in a backend database that can be accessed through web applications. Companies are increasingly employing mobile applications and IoT devices to facilitate business interactions, with many online transactions occurring at the application layer. Attackers often target applications to reach this data.

Using a WAF can help you meet compliance requirements such as PCI DSS (the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), which applies to any organization handling cardholder data and requires the installation of a firewall. A WAF is thus an essential component of an organization’s security model.

It is important to have a WAF, but it is recommended you combine it with other security measures, such as intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and traditional firewalls, to achieve a defense-in-depth security model.
